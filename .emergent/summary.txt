The previous AI engineer successfully developed a PWA for Dr. Zerquera, focusing on robust core functionalities and significant UX improvements. Initially, the work involved setting up the PWA, authentication, appointment management, dynamic content, and an internal messaging system. Subsequent efforts concentrated on addressing critical UI bugs, such as the disappearing mobile navigation bar and fixing the messaging system's bidirectional flow. A major task involved preparing the application for permanent domain configuration and assisting the user with understanding Emergent's deployment process versus self-hosting. Most recently, the engineer implemented comprehensive accessibility improvements for elderly patients, including larger touch targets, simplified navigation flows with prominent back buttons, enhanced message views for doctors, and a mobile-friendly appointment display. The image upload functionality was also a recurring challenge that the engineer attempted to resolve by creating dedicated backend endpoints and frontend components, eventually defaulting to a reliable temporary image solution while debugging the persistence issue. The previous session concluded with the engineer summarizing all implemented fixes and asking for a final deployment, but the user then pivoted to asking for future feature suggestions.

Dr. Zerquera, an Integrative Medical Institute, needs a complementary Android PWA. The app aims to synthesize services, provide contact info, and manage patient appointments. Initially, features included patient access, service synthesis, contact details, an appointment system (ideally with Acubliss integration), and a Dr. Zerquera profile.

Over time, requirements expanded to:
- Patient registration and login with distinct patient/admin roles.
- Admin section for appointment and content management.
- Dynamic service flyers editable by admin (offers, images, benefits, treatments, processes).
- Notifications (audio/text) for admin on new appointments/messages (though UI removed, core need persists).
- Fixing visual bugs: misaligned Dr. Zerquera image and disappearing mobile nav bar for admin.
- Internal patient-doctor messaging system.
- Correcting WhatsApp contact number.
- Desire for Google Play Store upload and permanent installation.
- User-friendly navigation for elderly patients, including clear back buttons and accessible UI.
- Professional appointment request system where the doctor assigns dates based on urgency, with patients providing detailed medical info.
- Functional in-app image upload for the doctor's profile.
- Sound notifications for the admin for new messages and appointments.
- Automated patient confirmation for appointments.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a series of critical UX and functionality issues reported by the user, and summarizing the changes.

1.  **Mobile Navigation Bar Persistence**: The user reported the mobile navigation bar disappearing on refresh for admin users. The AI engineer identified issues with the  state and authentication delays. The solution involved simplifying the logic in  to rely on  and  for immediate visibility, adding a 100ms delay for DOM readiness, and improving its layout with higher z-index, background blur, and increased padding ().
2.  **Messaging System Functionality**: The user reported broken bidirectional communication and notification issues. The AI engineer fixed inconsistent admin/patient IDs, improved the communication flow in  and , replaced intrusive alerts with elegant visual notifications, ensured admin could see all messages, and refined the De:/Para: logic. The frontend message view for admin was enhanced with larger fonts, individual view/reply buttons, and mobile-friendly card design to eliminate horizontal scrolling.
3.  **Doctor Image Management**: The user reported a misaligned doctor image and issues with the admin image upload system not applying changes. The AI engineer updated  to use a global  variable for persistent storage (with a default professional image), modified the  endpoint to correctly accept and save base64 image data via a Pydantic model (), and created a new  endpoint to serve the image. Frontend () was updated with a dedicated  component in the admin panel, providing upload with preview, validation, and immediate UI refresh. CSS was refined for better image encuadre ().
4.  **Navigation for Elderly Patients**: User requested improved navigation for elderly patients, specifically back buttons and better accessibility. The AI engineer implemented several changes in  and :
    *   **Service Flyer Modal**: Redesigned with an extra-large X button and a clear Volver button at the bottom.
    *   **Mobile Navigation Bar**: Increased icon and text size, larger touch areas, and visual scale effects on interaction.
    *   **Volver al Inicio Buttons**: Added prominent Volver al Inicio buttons on Doctor, Contact, Services, and Appointments pages.
    *   **Global CSS**: Introduced , , and  styles with increased , larger , and .
5.  **Made with Emergent Button Interference**: The user reported the Emergent branding button covering the mobile navigation. The AI engineer fixed this by applying a super high  to the mobile nav bar, adjusting content padding, and creating an  component in  to detect and reposition the Emergent button automatically.
6.  **Professional Appointment System**: User requested a system where the doctor assigns dates based on urgency. The appointment form in  was completely redesigned. Patients now provide their personal data, detailed reason for consultation, and urgency level (Normal, Moderada, Urgente, Emergencia), while the ability to select dates/times was removed. The confirmation message was updated to clearly state that the doctor will review and assign the best date.
7.  **Admin Appointment View and Notifications**: The confusing horizontal-scrolling admin appointment view was replaced with a mobile-friendly card-based design in . A sound notification system was implemented for the admin (), playing differentiated sounds for new messages and new appointment requests, with visual notifications and automatic polling. The backend () was updated to ensure patients receive automated confirmation messages (including details and telemedicina links) when their appointments are confirmed by the doctor.

The last interaction concluded with the AI engineer summarizing all these recent fixes and asking for a final deployment confirmation. However, the user then shifted to asking for future feature suggestions, which the AI has just provided.
